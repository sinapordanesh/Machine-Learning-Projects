    "Creating a machine learning model to predict 'Hours Viewed' and 'Rating' based on 'Title', 'Genre', 'Language', and 'Available Globally' from your dataset involves several steps, from data preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. Here's a roadmap:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "   - **Handle Missing Values**: Assess your dataset for any missing values and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).\n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "     - Extract relevant features from 'Title', like title length or presence of certain keywords.\n",
    "     - Convert 'Genre' and 'Language' into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "     - Convert 'Available Globally' to a binary format (True/False to 1/0).\n",
    "   - **Normalize or Scale Data**: Features like 'Hours Viewed' might need scaling to improve model performance.\n",
    "   - **Splitting the Dataset**: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets (commonly 80/20 or 70/30 split).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feature Selection\n",
    "   - Determine which features are most relevant to your predictions.\n",
    "   - Consider using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance from tree-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Selection\n",
    "   - Since you are predicting two different targets ('Hours Viewed' and 'Rating'), you'll need two separate models or a multi-output model.\n",
    "   - For 'Hours Viewed' (regression problem):\n",
    "     - Try models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.\n",
    "   - For 'Rating' (regression or classification, depending on how you treat it):\n",
    "     - If treated as a classification problem, use models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "     - For regression, the same models as 'Hours Viewed' can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Model Training\n",
    "   - Train your models on the training set.\n",
    "   - Use cross-validation to optimize model parameters and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "   - Evaluate your models on the testing set.\n",
    "   - For 'Hours Viewed', use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "   - For 'Rating', use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; RMSE or MAE for regression.\n",
    "   - Analyze the results to understand how well your models are performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Model Improvement\n",
    "   - Depending on the evaluation, you might need to return to feature engineering or model selection for improvements.\n",
    "   - Consider advanced techniques like ensemble methods or fine-tuning hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Deployment (Optional)\n",
    "   - If the model performs well, you can deploy it for real-time predictions.\n",
    "   - Consider creating a simple application or API where you can input the required features and receive the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Maintenance and Updates\n",
    "   - Regularly update the model with new data.\n",
    "   - Monitor the performance over time and retrain if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Ethical Considerations and Bias\n",
    "   - Be aware of potential biases in your dataset.\n",
    "   - Ensure that the use of your model complies with ethical standards and does not discriminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Tools\n",
    "   - **Python Libraries**: Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for modeling, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.\n",
    "   - **Advanced Libraries**: TensorFlow or PyTorch if you opt for deep learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "   - The success of your model heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the features used.\n",
    "   - It's crucial to understand the business context and potential implications of your predictions.\n",
    "   - Document your process thoroughly for future reference and possible audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of the steps and considerations involved in creating your predictive models. Each step might require iterative adjustments based on the performance and insights you gain as you progress."
